# Time-Series-Regression-Problem

## In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

## Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a regression problem.

## The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

We have a dataset of bulldozer sales prices over a period of time (for example, monthly sales prices over 10-20 years). We want to build a time series regression model to analyze and predict the trends in bulldozer prices.
 Plot the time series to visualize the trend, seasonality, and any outliers in the data. We may see an overall increasing or decreasing trend in prices over time. There may also be seasonal ups and downs corresponding to the business cycle.
